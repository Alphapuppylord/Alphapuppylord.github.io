                Science Olympiad
                <span class="showBodyOfDisplayOnHover">
                    In Science Olympiad I won at regional level a second place in both Meteorology and Dynamic Planet. Then at State I got seventh place on both of those. It was a lot of fun.

                I remade the game Asteroids in C++. It was a blast I did it in 48 hours. It was exhausting but still a lot of fun.

            Codecamp
            <span class="showBodyOfDisplayOnHover">
                Code camp is a 24 hours straight coding session to make the best game/app/something in that time period I have gone to it for a while and this year will be my fourth year. I don't ever win because I always put ourselves in a higher up level so we can compete how we like. I do not know what we will do for it this year but we will see. Maybe something with HTML and CSS and JavaScript.

                I get a 4.0 every quarter no matter what. I always have and I always will I work hard to keep it that way. Thankfully I have some good teachers who I can learn from and get my 4.0.
